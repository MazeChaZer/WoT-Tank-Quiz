 |-------------------*  Frequently Asked Questions : *----------------|
   
   » Can I use the fonts for commercial things, such as things I might
     get money for? Can I buy the font/fonts?

   » No!! If you want to do that you'll have to contact me first and
     get my permission. And we must set a deal, how much money I can
     earn from it. You can buy the font, it will cost between $65 - 
     $200 then you'll have the full rights to it.

     it, that means if you make a clickthru banner etc, with my font
     on it, you are making money thru my font. It have to free all 
     over or else it's not allowed.

     leave it that way. And it MUST include all original files such
     as the .ttf file and the readme.txt file + other. You cant
