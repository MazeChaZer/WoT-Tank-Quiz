Although the WoT Tank Quiz itself is free software, it includes some graphic material from wargaming.net.
In particular:

  - All tank images, they are from the official tankopedia
  - The World of Tanks-logo on the home screen

The World of Tanks support told me it's ok to use these images for non-commercial purposes, but nevertheless they are not covered by the GPL.
