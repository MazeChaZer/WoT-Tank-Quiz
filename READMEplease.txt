A big thank you goes to the website http://de.cooltext.com/ which i used to create the buttons and banners of the app. The image of the little tank in the app icon comes from the Open Clipart Library, thank you for that: http://openclipart.org/detail/97843/cartoon-tank-by-rg1024. I used GIMP to edit the images, it is a realy cool programm.
